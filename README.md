# OGL-ENGINE

## Build

To build the project and get started :

    Install vcpkg (https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg). build.bat assumes that it is installed in C:/vcpkg, so you will need to update it if you set another install directory
    
    Then, simply run build.bat to get started with building/running ogl-engine.exe


## Getting Started

Replace all occurences of "ogl-engine", "ogl_engine" and "OGL-ENGINE" with your project name. Then update this readme and get to work ðŸ’ª

Documentation for the engine is available [right there](http://yadev83.github.io/ogl-engine)
